## Progress Report 2 - Prepared 10/25/2020

# Accomplishments for This Reporting Period:
Assembled proper list of milestones for remainder of project

Finished working through playlist of Unreal Engine tutorial videos to gain additional familiarity with the engine

Assembled list of Unreal Engine tutorial articles to read to further increase familiarity and skill

Finished working through list of Unreal Engine tutorial articles much faster than anticipated as familiarity grew

Consulted with potential playtesters for approval of planned features

Consulted with personal friend who has significantly more experience with Unreal Engine to determine if planned project is still feasible by the project deadline, and received confirmation that it is

Slightly revised milestone dates based upon increased knowledge of engine and conversation with personal friend

Achieved at least 90 hours worked on the project and brought myself back in line with the expected time investment


# Accomplishments Planned but Not Completed This Reporting Period:
More consistent updating of GitHub website

Extensive modification of side scroller prototype

Creation of Demo Video 1


# Root Cause of Variances:
There are two root causes of variances for the planned accomplishments, with one root cause applying to two of the above issues. 

For the failure to update the website more consistently and the failure to create Demo Video 1, the root cause was my own forgetfulness regarding them both, in the midst of increasingly complicated work in other subjects and my learning of Unreal Engine. I simply allowed myself to forget both of these objectives in the midst of that other work, which was unacceptable.

The reason for the second, my inability to make significant modifications to the prototype, was simply a mistake in the planning for this reporting period. I had significantly overestimated the simplicity of such modifications and viewed my inability to implement them in the first recording period as a severe failure. Now that I have gained much more familiarity with the engine, I realize that it was an unrealistic planned accomplishment for that period of time. Thanks to this increased familiarity, that no longer applies, and I can begin making the modifications I initially had in mind.


# Impact to Upcoming Milestones or Project Due Date:
These variances should have very little impact on the upcoming milestones or project due date, if any, as a result of their very nature. Updating the website more consistently in the upcoming reporting period should not greatly impact the milestones for the main project itself, nor should the production of Demo Videos 1 and 2, and the plan to make significant modifications to the side-scroller project within the amount of time since the last reporting period was ill-conceived to begin with, as I was not yet familiar enough with the Unreal Engine to do so.


# Planned Corrective or Preventive Action:
My planned corrective and preventive action for updating the website more consistently is to set a weekly alarm for when to begin modifying it. I will also retroactively add all the previous time logs and the previous Progress Report to the website within the next two weeks.  

The only corrective action to be taken in regards to the modifications to the side scroller prototype is to simply make those modifications, now that I have gained enough experience with the engine to be capable of doing so.

My planned corrective action for not creating Video Demo 1 is to download proper screen recording and video editing software to produce both it and Video Demo 2. Video Demo 1 will be e-mailed directly to you at the same time that I post Video Demo 2 to the appropriate discussion board.


# Summary of Upcoming Tasks
The upcoming tasks for the coursework include the creation of Demo Videos 1, 2, and 3, the continued production of time logs, the production of Progress Report 3, and the updating of my GitHub website.

Just as before, the specific upcoming tasks for the project itself include modification of the physics, textures, and basic features that I intended to implement, though recreating the template from scratch is no longer necessary. Once I have accomplished these objectives, I will send the game to some individuals I have already successfully recruited as playtesters for the sake of bug identification and receiving feedback on the core gameplay. 


# Accomplishments Planned for Next Reporting Period
My planned accomplishments for the next reporting period are simply to reach the requisite 180 hours spent on the project in total, implement the game modifications mentioned above, create all three demo videos, retroactively add the previous time logs and progress report to the website, and to fulfill all of the remaining project requirements, such as the Most Meaningful Objective Report.


# New Risks Identified/Risk
As with the previous progress report, no new major risks have made themselves known over the course of this second reporting period. I do not believe any will become apparent in the third either.


# Issues
The only issues that I was able to identify within this reporting period were my own forgetfulness and improper expectations of my own capabilities, as discussed above in “Accomplishments Planned but Not Completed This Reporting Period.”


# Comments
Thanks to the time spent focusing on the Unreal Engine tutorials this reporting period, I finally feel as though I can truly begin making significant visible progress with this project. Previously I had felt as though my pace was incredibly slow, and though it was certainly slower than it should have been, my time spent truly learning the engine has shown me that the gulf between my pace of work and what my pace of work should have been was not quite as wide as I had thought, due to my inexperience at the time. In addition to that realization, I now also have the tools needed to shrink that gulf significantly.

I would also like to note that I am improving at devising actionable plans to address the personal flaws I discussed in the previous progress report. It was initially difficult to determine ways of doing so that would not interfere with my other coursework, but I have begun to strike a better balance between that coursework and this project, making those plans easier to devise and execute.

I am very excited to continue working on this project, and now feel that I will certainly be able to deliver what I initially set out to.
